# ABOUT 

Digital wall clocks are common items seen in almost every household, office, and industry. It is a common but essential household item that allows us to get our bearings and gives us a sense of the day we are spending. Buying a new wall clock will generally cost you a bit more money than you would initially expect since it is the basic habit of shopkeepers to dupe their customers. But luckily there is a simple way of making a digital wall clock. So in today’s tutorial, we are going to go over a step by step procedure on how to design a DIY Digital Wall Clock Using Arduino ATMega328p 8-Bit AVR MCU IC.
